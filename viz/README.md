# Binary visualization for firmware files

Because images are cool and visualizing the code format of a binary file makes it quite
quick to have an idea of what hell we are getting ourselves into. Using binvis and
generic pgm file format generation.

<code>(echo P5 4096 512 255; cat [ action_file ] > output.pgm</code>

- open file in an image viewer like feh or photoshop
